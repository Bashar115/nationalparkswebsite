<section id="about">
    <h2>Plan your trip</h2>
    <p>Yosemite National Park, located in the western Sierra Nevada of Central California, 
    is renowned for its stunning granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves,
    and biological diversity. Its history is long and varied, involving Native Americans, European explorers,
    prospectors, conservationists, and the US government.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Research and choose dates</h2>
    <P>Research Yosemite's weather and crowd patterns to choose the best time for your visit. If you prefer fewer crowds, consider visiting in mid to late September. Check the availability of accommodations during your chosen dates.</P>
    </p>
    <h2>Accomodations reservations</h2>
    <p>Reserve a campsite at Upper Pines Campground in Yosemite Valley for a central location. Make reservations six months in advance, especially if planning a visit during the busy summer months.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Transportations</h2>
    <p>Book a flight to Fresno Yosemite International Airport. Rent a car for flexibility within the park. Consider using the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (YARTS) for eco-friendly transport.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Parky entry and permits</h2>
    <p>Purchase a 7-day entrance pass online. If planning to hike Half Dome, secure a permit through the lottery system. Check for any trailhead quotas or fire restrictions.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Create an itinerary</h2>
    <p>Day 1: Explore Yosemite Valley, visit Yosemite Falls and El Capitan. Day 2: Hike the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Falls. Day 3: Drive to Glacier Point and explore Mariposa Grove to see the Giant Sequoias.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Pack appropriately</h2>
    <p>Pack layers for varying temperatures. Bring sturdy hiking boots, a daypack with snacks, a water reservoir, and a camera for capturing scenic moments. If camping, ensure you have a reliable tent, sleeping bag, and cooking equipment.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Health and safety</h2>
    <p>Check for any health advisories or park alerts closer to your trip. Bring a basic first aid kit, any required medications, and be aware of your physical fitness for chosen activities.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Leave no trace</h2>
    <p>Adhere to Leave No Trace principles: stay on designated trails, properly dispose of waste, and respect wildlife. Bring reusable containers and minimize single-use items.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Photography gear</h2>
    <p>Pack your DSLR camera or smartphone with additional lenses. Consider a tripod for capturing sunrise or sunset shots. Familiarize yourself with photography guidelines within the park.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Check park updates</h2>
    <p>Regularly check the official Yosemite National Park website for any updates, road closures, or special events. Contact the visitor center for specific information on trail conditions or unforeseen circumstances.</p>
