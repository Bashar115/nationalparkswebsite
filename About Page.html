    <h2>Geography of The Park</h2>
    <p>
        Yosemite National Park, a geologic masterpiece nestled in the Sierra Nevada of California, boasts a landscape that is both awe-inspiring and diverse. The park's most iconic feature is its granite monoliths, such as the renowned El Capitan and Half Dome, which were shaped over millions of years by the forces of glacial and erosive processes. These colossal formations stand as sentinels, dominating the skyline and creating a dramatic backdrop against the ever-changing hues of the sky. Yosemite's glacially-carved valleys, including Yosemite Valley itself, showcase U-shaped formations with sheer cliffs and cascading waterfalls, offering visitors a visual feast of natural wonders.
        </p>
        The Merced River winds its way through Yosemite, cutting through the valleys and nourishing the park's ecosystems. The river contributes to the creation of serene lakes and provides a lifeline for the diverse flora and fauna that call Yosemite home. The park's elevation spans from about 2,000 feet to over 13,000 feet, encompassing a variety of habitats from chaparral and oak woodlands in the lower elevations to alpine meadows and coniferous forests in the higher elevations. The stark elevation changes contribute to the park's ecological diversity, creating niches for different plant and animal species to thrive.
        </p>
        Yosemite's geography is also marked by its numerous waterfalls, with Yosemite Falls being the tallest in North America. The park is a mosaic of lush meadows, pristine lakes, and dense forests, offering a visual symphony that changes with the seasons. Whether blanketed in snow during the winter or adorned with vibrant wildflowers in the spring and summer, Yosemite's geography is a testament to the power and artistry of natural forces, inviting visitors to explore its varied terrains and discover the geological wonders that have shaped this extraordinary landscape.
